# Add To Vault *(Obsidian Plugin)*
A lightweight and modular service for adding articles, comments & finds to your Obsidian vault.

**Transparency Notice:** *This project is "vibe-coded".* The architecture, backend logic, and frontend codebase were *primarily* written and iterated by Google's Gemini Pro large language model under the direction of a human project manager. The focus is on **function**, **modularity**, and **privacy**.

### Overview
**Add To Vault** is a two-part system designed to capture, summarize, and link web content securely. While the [backend server](https://github.com/epicylon/add-to-vault/tree/main) handles the heavy lifting (web scraping and LLM processing), this plugin sits quietly in your Obsidian vault and acts as the secure courier.

It performs *two* main tasks:

1. **Pushing Context:** It reads the filenames in your vault and securely pushes this index to your server. This allows the server's LLM to generate intelligent [[internal links]] to concepts you already know.

2. **Pulling Notes:** It periodically polls your server's secure inbox for newly generated markdown files, downloads them directly into your vault, and deletes them from the server.

### Prerequisites
- An active, self-hosted instance of the Add To Vault Server. (Update link when ready)

- A generated Bearer Token (found in your server's web dashboard under the "Profile" tab).

- A Google Gemini API Key.

### Manual Installation

Until this plugin is available in the official Obsidian Community Plugins directory, you can install it manually:

1. Download the latest ```main.js``` and ```manifest.json``` files from the Releases tab *(or build them from source)*.

2. Open your Obsidian vault folder.

3. Navigate to ```.obsidian/plugins/```.

4. Create a new folder named ```add-to-vault```.

5. Place ```main.js``` and ```manifest.json``` inside this new folder.

6. Restart Obsidian, go to Settings -> Community Plugins, disable Safe Mode, and enable "Add To Vault".

### Configuration & Authentication
Navigate to the Add To Vault settings tab inside Obsidian to configure the connection:

1. **Create an Account:** Visit your self-hosted server's web dashboard and register for an account.

2. **Get Your Token:** Once logged in, navigate to the Profile tab in the dashboard and click "Show / Hide Token". Copy this Bearer Token.

3. **Obsidian Setup:** Paste the token into the "Server API Token" field in the plugin settings. Set your API URL (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:8000).

#### Other Settings:

- **Gemini API Key:** Your Google AI Studio key. (Note: This is securely transmitted and stored on your own server).

- **LLM Model:** Select your preferred model (e.g., gemini-2.5-flash).

- **Inbox Folder:** The local folder where new notes should be saved.

- **LLM Prompt Templates:** Point to local .md files for Archivist, Analyst, and Synthesist modes. Variables supported: {title}, {url}, {content}, {vault_context}.

### Development

To build this plugin from source:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.

3. Run ```npm run build``` to compile the TypeScript source code into the final ```main.js``` file.

### Architecture

The project consists of a **FastAPI** backend utilizing **SQLAlchemy** *(SQLite)* for user management. Web scraping is handled via **BeautifulSoup4**. LLM interactions are orchestrated through **LangChain**. The frontend is a single-page HTML application styled with **Tailwind CSS**, served directly by FastAPI.
